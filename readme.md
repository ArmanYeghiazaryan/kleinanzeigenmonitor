Hi, 

this is a basic eBayKleinanzeigen-Monitor Script, which sends you a Discord-Webhook once a new product / item has been posted for your desired category. 

It will launch a selenium browser, log in and grab the cookies automatically. There is a captcha solution integrated.

Monitoring new items will be request-based in order to as fast as possible.

Enjoy!


PS: Please bear in mind, that this was a private project and has not seen an update for a long time now.
